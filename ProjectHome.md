BallViewer is a novel molecular dynamics visulization application that was originally designed to take input from [MOLDY](http://code.google.com/p/moldy/), a molecular dynamics simulation developed by [Prof. Graeme Ackland](http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/graeme/) and others at the University of Edinburgh.  Since then it has grown to take a variety of inputs including plain x y z data available from many molecular dynamics simulations.  A novel feature of  BallViewer is the ability to automatically identify crystall structure including BCC, HCC, HCP and others.

Features:
  * Written in Java to support a variety of platforms including Windows, Linux, Solaris etc.
  * Automatic crystal stucture identification.
  * Ability to create movie from multiple snapshots of the simulation - very useful for giving presentations and sharing your work.
  * Unique analysis framework allows users to quickly import additional data about atoms such as energy or atomic number and use this to color balls for easy identification.
